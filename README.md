# SkinCare-Hub
Skin Care Hub is an application using ML for analyse and identify skin annomalies, and provide better solutions for that. Implemented for skin care centers and beauty palors and salons as well as individual users.

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at detecting various skin anomalies, such as pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, rashes, and other conditions, in facial images.

Features:

    Implementation of a multi-label classification model using deep learning techniques.
    Dataset containing close-up images of different skin anomalies for training and evaluation.
    Jupyter notebook for model training, evaluation, and inference using Google Colab.
    Experimentation with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters.
    Integration with cloud services for model hosting and deployment.

Usage:

    Clone the repository to your local machine or Google Colab environment.
    Open the Jupyter notebook (skin_anomaly_detection.ipynb) in Google Colab.
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new images.
    Save the trained model for deployment using cloud services like Google Cloud AI Platform or TensorFlow Serving.
